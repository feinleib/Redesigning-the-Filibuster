# Introduction
I measure the distance between the breakpoints on failed cloture votes and the ideal point of the potential 60th vote for cloture. This distance can be interpreted as a measurement of the cost a new filibuster rule would have to impose to change the outcome of a cloture vote.

# Data
* failed cloture votes

```{r data import}
sen_votes_data <- get_voteview_rollcall_votes(chamber = "s", congress = 117)
sen_mem_votes_data <- get_voteview_member_votes(chamber = "s", congress = 117)
```
