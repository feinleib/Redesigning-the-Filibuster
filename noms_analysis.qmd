## Introduction
To test the effect of real-life filibuster reforms, I measure the difference in supporting coalitions on presidential nominations before and after the nuclear options in 2013 and 2017.

## Data
I use presidential nominations for executive-branch and judicial-branch positions. I divide nomination votes according to whether they came before or after the nuclear option:
* November 21, 2013 for executive-branch and non-Supreme Court judicial-branch nominees
* April 6, 2017 for Supreme Court nominees
```{r data import}
# starting in 1989, when `bill_number` data became complete
nominations_data <- get_voteview_rollcall_votes(chamber = "s", congress = 101:117) |> 
  filter(str_starts(bill_number, "PN"))

# presidents data for their ideologies
presidents <- get_voteview_members(chamber = "s", congress = 101:117) |> 
  filter(chamber == "President",
         !(congress == 117 & str_starts(bioname, "TRUMP")))

parties <- get_voteview_parties(chamber = "s", congress = 101:117)

# cloture_actions <- get_senate_cloture_votes() |> 
#   filter(congress < 118)

nuclear_2013 <- as.Date("2013-11-21")
nuclear_2017 <- as.Date("2017-04-06")
```

Transformation: 
* Filtering to the confirmation vote
* Determining which votes came after the nuclear option
```{r data transformation}
party_sizes <- parties |> 
  filter(party_name != "Independent", 
         # filter out Trump for 117th
         !(congress == 117 & chamber == "President" & party_name == "Republican")) |> 
  # find the President's party
  mutate(pres_party = first(party_name), 
         .by = congress, .after = congress) |> 
  # now remove presidents
  filter(chamber != "President") |> 
  # normalize to 100 members
  # TODO: use senate.gov party size data from `filibustr` when available
  mutate(pct_members = n_members / sum(n_members) * 100, 
         .by = congress, .after = n_members) |>
  # just the President's party
  filter(pres_party == party_name) |> 
  select(congress, pres_party, pres_party_size = pct_members)

# re-using `cloture_actions` df from @fig-cloture-graph (Sec. 2.1)
cloture_actions <- cloture_actions |> 
  filter(congress >= 101) |> 
  select(congress, cloture_motions_filed = motions_filed)



nominations <- nominations_data |> 
  filter(vote_question == "On the Nomination") |> 
  mutate(
    # SCOTUS nominations
    scotus = str_detect(vote_desc, "(Associate|Chief) Justice"),
    # votes after the nuclear option
    post_nuclear = (
      (date > nuclear_2017 | (congress == 115 & rollnumber == 110)) 
      | (!scotus & (date > nuclear_2013 | (congress == 113 & rollnumber == 244)))
    ),
    vote_pct = yea_count / (yea_count + nay_count) * 100,
    yrs_since_89 = interval(as.Date("1989-01-01"), date) / years(1)
  ) |> 
  # join party size and cloture data
  inner_join(party_sizes, by = "congress") |> 
  inner_join(cloture_actions, by = "congress")
```
