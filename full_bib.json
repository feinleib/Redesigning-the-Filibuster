		"abstract": "Majority leaders of the contemporary Congress preside over parties that are more cohesive than at any point in the modern era, and power has been centralized in party leadership offices. Do today’s majority parties succeed in enacting their legislative agendas to a greater extent than the less-cohesive parties of earlier eras? To address this question, we examine votes on all laws enacted from 1973–2016, as well as on the subset of landmark laws identified by Mayhew. In addition, we analyze the efforts of congressional majority parties to pass their agendas from 1985 to 2016. We find that enacting coalitions in recent congresses are nearly as bipartisan as they were in the 1970s. Most laws, including landmark enactments, continue to garner substantial bipartisan support. Furthermore, majority parties have not gotten better at passing their legislative programs. Contemporary congressional majorities actually fail on their agenda items at somewhat higher rates than the less-cohesive majority parties of the 1980s and 1990s. When majority parties succeed on their agenda priorities, they usually do so with support from a majority of the minority party in at least one chamber and with the endorsement of one or more of the minority party’s top leaders.",

These findings suggest that the Senate's rules, which require bipartisan cooperation, may foster productivity in lawmaking.",

Yet as Adam Jentleson shows, the problem not only goes back to the nineteenth century, but is less about the presidency than it is about our nation's most venerated institution: the United States Senate. A revelatory history of minority rule in America as expressed through the Senate filibuster, Kill Switch shows that white conservatives have long relied on the filibuster--which is not featured in the Constitution, and which, as Jentleson demonstrates, the Framers would have opposed--to shut down attempts to create a multiracial democracy. Featuring a new epilogue on filibuster battles under the Biden administration, Kill Switch will remain an essential warning about the costs of empowering this nation's right-wing minority.",

We note two sets of ﬁndings. First, replacement seems to have driven depolarization to a larger extent than conversion, but with diﬀerent patterns among Republicans and Democrats. Second, both qualitative and roll call evidence suggests that agricultural and tariﬀ policies were key early areas of interparty cooperation, providing important opportunities for cross-party and cross-regional coalitions (like the Farm Bloc and the Progressive Coalition) to form before the Conservative Coalition emerged in the late-1930s.",

		"abstract": "Formal models of politics regularly combine assumptions about a variety of actors and institutions to produce equilibrium expectations, which serve as the primary target for empirical testing. Yet the underlying assumptions can vary in their accuracy among actors and across time and context. We focus on the pivotal politics model of lawmaking and argue that a full evaluation of the theory requires a granular analysis of its two primary components: the ﬁlibuster and veto \"pivots\" in Congress. We show that both types of pivots contribute to the success of pivotal politics in explaining postwar lawmaking, but that the relevance of each varies based on institution-speciﬁc contexts. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁlibuster pivot has little explanatory power before the 1970s, when norms of ﬁlibuster use were quite restrictive, while the veto pivot’s explanatory power is limited to situations in which the president has sufﬁcient public backing to be a force in the legislative process.",

		"abstract": "Many recorded roll calls in Congress each year are votes on bills that have no chance of becoming law, or are purely symbolic, or are procedural without policy content. Yet models of voting and measurement models of member preferences make assumptions that vote choices are largely about utility derived from policies. We consider the possibility that votes plausibly connected to policy and votes not plausibly connected to policy may have different data-generating processes and rely on different utility functions. Substantively, similarity across different contexts for policy change implies an importance of messaging over policy. Methodologically, similarity across these contexts is necessary to avoid biasing estimates of member preferences. We find that members’ voting patterns are highly stable across contexts in which policy change is credible and not credible. This indicates that existing measures of ideal points are likely not dramatically biased by the inclusion of policy-irrelevant votes.",

They were instigated by Senators in each party frustrated by the chamber’s inability to enact social and civil rights legislation because of the opposition of other Members. The biennial focus declined somewhat when the Senate in 1975 amended Rule XXII to reduce the number of Senators required to invoke cloture from two-thirds of the Senators present and voting to threefifths of the Senators chosen and sworn (60 of 100). In 1979 and 1986, the Senate also amended Rule XXII by reducing the length of time for post-cloture debate. However, senatorial interest in revising Rule XXII on “opening day” reemerged in the 2000s.",

		"abstract": "We review debates concerning the evolution and impact of parliamentary obstruction in the U.S. Senate, focusing on path dependency versus remote majoritarian perspectives. We consider the viability of circumventing supermajority requirements for rules changes by using rulings from the chair to establish precedents. Because the viability of this approach depends, at least in part, on the anticipated reaction of the public, we conduct a preliminary analysis of public opinion data from the 1940s through the 1960s and from the showdown over the obstruction of judicial nominees in 2005. We contend that the balance of the evidence favors the position that senators have generally supported the maintenance of the filibuster and have been able to make procedural adjustments when obstruction threatened a committed majority's top priorities, although we offer some important refinements required in comparing the historical operation of obstruction to its impact in today's Senate.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this review is to take stock of how party polarization affects governance in the United States. The article begins by defining polarization and discussing the means by which it can be measured. It is undeniable that the two parties have grown more sharply differentiated. Some evidence suggests that the substantive policy preferences of liberals and conservatives diverge more widely, but the case for ideological polarization in the spatial sense is not definitive. Effects on the institutional processes of US government have entailed a hardening of party divisions and a tendency toward centralization of power. Nevertheless, these more cohesive parties are not more effective than their predecessors at enacting policies or managing routine governing responsibilities. The consequences for public policy seem best characterized as “drift” ( Hacker 2004 , p. 246). There is little evidence that party polarization has promoted ideologically extreme policy outcomes or has systematically advantaged either liberalism or conservatism.",

		"abstract": "We confront the puzzle of why bipartisanship is alive and well in Congress, despite notable increases in party polarization and rising primary election threats. The answer is remarkably simple—bipartisanship unambiguously helps individual legislators who seek to advance their policy goals. We show that members of the House and Senate from the 93rd to 114th Congresses (1973–2016) who attract a larger portion of their bill cosponsors from the opposing party are much more successful at lawmaking. We show these patterns to be remarkably robust to both majority-party and minority-party lawmakers, under changing legislative and electoral conditions and over time. Moreover, a clear path to attracting bipartisan cosponsors involves reciprocity, making cosponsoring others’ bills across party lines attractive.",

Makes non-debatable any motion to: (1) go into executive session to consider a specified item of executive business; or (2) proceed to consider any privileged matter.\n\nProhibits a Senator from objecting on behalf of another Senator to proceeding to a motion or matter without disclosing that Senator's name (thus eliminating secret holds).\n\nAmends Rule XXII (Precedence of Motions) to authorize the majority and minority leader, after debate has concluded under the rule (cloture) but before final disposition of the pending matter, to each offer up to three amendments identified as leadership amendments if they have been timely filed and are germane to the matter being amended.

Requires the Senate, if the question on a cloture motion is decided in the negative, to enter a period of continuous debate (filibuster) on the pending measure, motion, other matter, or the unfinished business. Requires such period to continue as long as the subject of the cloture vote is the pending business. Requires the Presiding Officer, if no Senator seeks recognition during the period of a filibuster, to note that such period has ended and cloture shall be considered invoked.\n\nRequires the reading of any Senate or House amendment to be dispensed with, after cloture is invoked (as under the current Rule) or during a filibuster period, when the proposed amendment has been: (1) identified; and (2) available in printed form at the desk of the Members for at least 24 hours.\nLimits postcloture debate on a nomination to two hours.",

It counts the occurrences of a word and syntagma for a chosen corpus and a given period and offers several visualization options of the resulting data. For researchers, this software offers several assets: a large enough volume of data sufficient for lexicometric analysis from 1600 to present; transparency, which its competitor Ngram Viewer notably lacks; and a more constant structure throughout time. This article presents Gallibase, its extension which applies the tools of textual statistics, in particular factor analysis and tree clustering. It illustrates its potential and insists on the value of press corpora, which allows for the study of short periods.",

Notwithstanding this research, we provide a model showing that supermajority coalitions may be cheaper than minimal winning coalitions. Specifically, if vote buyers move sequentially, and if the losing vote buyer is always granted a last chance to attack the winner's coalition, then minimal winning coalitions will generally not be cheapest, and equilibrium coalitions will generally not be minimal winning. We provide results relating equilibrium coalition size with preferences of the legislators and vote buyers, and we show that minimal winning coalitions should occur in only rare cases. We discuss these results in light of empirical work on coalition size and suggest other possible avenues for testing our model.",

		"abstract": "Controversy over the Senate's filibuster practice dominates modem discussion of American legislative government. With increasing frequency, commentators have urged that the upper chamber's requirement of sixty votes to close debate on pending matters violates a majority-rule-based norm of constitutional law. Proponents of this view, however, tend to gloss over a more basic question: Does the Constitution's Rules of Proceedings Clause permit the houses of Congress to adopt internal parliamentary requirements under which a bill is deemed \"passed\" only if it receives supermajority support? This question is important. Indeed, the House already has such a rule in place, and any challenge to the Senate cloture rule is doomed from the start if that body may self-impose supermajority voting thresholds even for the actual enactment of laws. Existing scholarly work in this area, however, is incomplete. The most elaborate treatments invoke originalist principles to claim that the chambers of Congress may freely adopt supermajority (as well as submajority) bill-voting requirements. These treatments have spawned critical responses, but none of them focuses in full-blown fashion on the words and deeds of the Framers themselves. This Article fills the resulting gap by offering a wide-ranging argument against supermajority voting rules based on constitutional text, constitutional structure, and background understandings that pervaded the framing period. Taken as a whole, these controlling indicators of original meaning establish that a bill is passed if and only if it receives a majority vote.",

Both supporters and critics of the filibuster agree that any filibuster reform would require extraordinary measures. In contrast to this consensus, this Article describes a method we call the “conventional option,” which allows the filibuster to be reformed by a simple majority of senators at any time using ordinary Senate procedures. As we show below, a majority of senators\nusing the conventional option (1) cannot be filibustered; (2) can act on any day the Senate is in session (not just at the beginning of a new Congress); and (3) does not need to invoke the Constitution. In fact, this Article shows that both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have limited filibustering in the past by using the conventional option described here.",

Unique to the upper chamber, holds can be understood as information-sharing devices predicated on the unanimous consent nature of Senate decisionmaking. Senators place holds to accomplish a variety of purposes—to receive notification of upcoming legislative proceedings, for instance, or to express objections to a particular proposal or executive nomination—but ultimately the decision to honor a hold request, and for how long, rests with the majority leader. Scheduling Senate business is the fundamental prerogative of the majority leader, and this responsibility is typically carried out in consultation with the minority leader.",
